### What I learned

In this task I learn more about putting a footer in my page since i didn't put it on my latest task. Sure it doesn't seem like a big progress but I feel satisfied when I saw that big block green below of the content. Hopefully I can learn more about frontend stuffs and build more task until I feel confident to build mine. Thanks to Frontend Mentor!
