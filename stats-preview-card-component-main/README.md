### What I learned

In this task, I have a trouble with adding different color in the image. I tried to add a div and set the position to absolute to make the div above of the image. Then I added a color and set opacity to make the image visible.

```css
background: hsl(295, 48%, 24%);
opacity: 0.7;
```
